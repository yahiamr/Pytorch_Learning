# Neural Network Basics in PyTorch

## Overview
This directory contains a Python script, `NN.py`, which serves as an introductory example of building and applying neural network models using PyTorch. It is designed for those new to neural networks in PyTorch, illustrating basic concepts and operations.

## Contents
- `NN.py`: A script that shows how to create and use neural network layers and models in PyTorch.

### Script Breakdown
1. **Linear Layer**: Demonstrates the creation of a linear layer (`nn.Linear`) and its application to a simple input tensor.
2. **Sequential Model**: Constructs a sequential neural network model using multiple linear layers. The model is then applied to the same input tensor to demonstrate its functionality.

## Usage
To run this script, ensure PyTorch is installed in your Python environment. Execute the script using the following command:
```
python NN.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch

## Getting Started
This script is a straightforward introduction to constructing and using neural network layers in PyTorch. It provides a basis for understanding how neural networks can be built and tested in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.
