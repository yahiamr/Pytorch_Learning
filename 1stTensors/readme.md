# Tensors Introduction in PyTorch

## Overview
This directory contains a Python script, `tensors.py`, providing an introductory demonstration of tensor operations in PyTorch. It is designed to help users familiarize themselves with basic tensor manipulation in this popular deep learning library.

## Contents
- `tensors.py`: A script that illustrates various ways to create and manipulate tensors in PyTorch. 

### Script Breakdown
1. **Creating a Tensor from List Data**: The script begins by demonstrating how to create a tensor directly from a Python list.
2. **Tensor from a NumPy Array**: It then shows how to convert a NumPy array into a tensor, illustrating the interoperability between PyTorch and NumPy.
3. **Creating Tensors with Specific Properties**:
    - **Ones Tensor**: Creating a tensor with the same shape as an existing tensor but filled with ones.
    - **Random Tensor**: Generating a tensor with the same shape as an existing tensor but with random values, also demonstrating how to override the data type of the original tensor.

## Usage
To run this script, ensure PyTorch and NumPy are installed in your Python environment. Execute the script using the following command:
```
python tensors.py
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy

## Getting Started
For those new to PyTorch, this script is a starting point to understand how tensors are created and manipulated. Tensors are fundamental to operations in PyTorch, serving as the primary data structure for neural network inputs and outputs.
