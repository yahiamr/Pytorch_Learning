# Pseudo-code for Training a Model in PyTorch

# 1. Import necessary libraries
import necessary libraries (PyTorch, sklearn, etc.)

# 2. Load and preprocess the dataset
Load the dataset
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
Normalize the data if necessary
Convert the data to PyTorch tensors

# 3. Create custom Dataset classes for PyTorch
Define a custom Dataset class (e.g., IrisDataset)
    Implement __init__, __len__, and __getitem__ methods

# 4. Create DataLoader for both training and testing sets
Initialize DataLoader for the training set (specify batch size, shuffle, etc.)
Initialize DataLoader for the testing set

# 5. Define the model architecture
Define the neural network class (e.g., GenericNet)
    Implement __init__ with layers definition
    Implement forward method with the data flow through the layers

# 6. Initialize the model, loss function, and optimizer
Create an instance of the model
Define the loss function (e.g., CrossEntropyLoss for classification)
Define the optimizer (e.g., Adam, SGD, etc.)

# 7. Set up the training loop with epochs
For each epoch:
    # a. Training phase
    Set the model to training mode
    Initialize or reset variables to track training loss
    For each batch in the training DataLoader:
        Perform model forward pass with batch data
        Compute loss
        Perform backpropagation (loss.backward())
        Update model parameters (optimizer.step())
        Aggregate the training loss

    # b. Evaluation phase
    Set the model to evaluation mode
    Initialize variables to track evaluation metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy)
    Disable gradient computations (torch.no_grad)
    For each batch in the testing DataLoader:
        Perform model forward pass with batch data
        Compute loss
        Update evaluation metrics (e.g., count correct predictions)

    Calculate and print average training loss and evaluation metrics

# 8. (Optional) Save the model, plot metrics, perform additional analysis
