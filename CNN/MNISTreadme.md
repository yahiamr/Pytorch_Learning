# üåü MNIST CNN Training with PyTorch üåü

## Overview
This guide elaborates on a Python script for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch. Each section of the code is explained in detail for a comprehensive understanding.

### Contents:
1. **Importing Libraries**
2. **Loading and Splitting the MNIST Dataset**
3. **Defining the CNN Model**
4. **Defining Loss Function and Optimizer**
5. **Training the Model**

### 1. üìö Importing Libraries
```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
```
- `torch`: Core library for tensor operations and GPU acceleration.
- `torchvision`: Facilitates data loading for vision tasks.
- `transforms`: Preprocessing image data.
- `nn`: Building blocks for neural networks.
- `optim`: Optimization algorithms.

### 2. üì¶ Loading and Splitting the MNIST Dataset
```python
# Transformations
transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), transforms.Normalize((0.5,), (0.5,))])

# Training Data
trainset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)

# Testing Data
testset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(root='./data', train=False, download=True, transform=transform)
testloader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(testset, batch_size=64, shuffle=False)
```
- **Transformations**: Images are converted into PyTorch tensors. Normalization is applied to the images (mean=0.5, std=0.5) for more effective training.
- **MNIST Dataset**: A classic dataset containing 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. It's split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
- **Training Set (`trainset`)**: Used to train the model. Contains 60,000 examples.
- **Testing Set (`testset`)**: Used to evaluate the model's performance. Contains 10,000 examples.
- **DataLoaders (`trainloader` and `testloader`)**: Provide an iterable over the datasets with options for batch processing and shuffling. `batch_size=64` means that the data will be processed in batches of 64 images.

### 3. üèó Defining the CNN Model
```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    ...
net = Net()
```
- **Architecture**: Two convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by dropout layers for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification.
- **Activation Functions**: ReLU used for introducing non-linearity.
- **Pooling**: Reduces spatial dimensions and computational load.

---

### 4. üîß Defining Loss Function and Optimizer
```python
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(net.parameters(), lr=0.001)
```
- **CrossEntropyLoss**: Ideal for multi-class classification problems.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Adaptive learning rate, generally faster convergence.

---

### 5. üöÄ Training the Model
```python
for epoch in range(10):  
    ...
```
- **Epochs**: Multiple passes over the dataset.
- **Backpropagation**: Adjusts weights to minimize loss.
- **Running Loss Tracking**: Monitors training progress.

## Usage
Run the script in a Python environment with PyTorch installed. The script downloads MNIST and starts training, showcasing the model's performance on digit classification.
