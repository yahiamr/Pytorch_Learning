### Visual Pseudo Code for PyTorch Training Loop

1. **Prepare for the Journey**
   ```
   [📦] Load Data: DataLoader
   [🤖] Build Model: Sequential
   [🎯] Set Target: Loss Function
   [🚀] Choose Path: Optimizer
   ```

2. **Start the Adventure (Loop Through Epochs)**
   ```
   For each Epoch:
   │
   ├── 🔄 Loop Through Data Batches
   │    │
   │    ├── [👀] Observe Data: Get Batch
   │    ├── [🔮] Predict Future: Model Forward Pass
   │    ├── [❓] Question Accuracy: Calculate Loss
   │    ├── [🔙] Learn from Past: Backpropagate
   │    └── [👣] Step Forward: Update Model (Optimizer Step)
   │
   └── 📈 Check Progress: Print Epoch & Loss
   ```

3. **Conclude the Journey**
   ```
   [🏁] Finish Training: All Epochs Done
   [🔍] Reflect: Evaluate Model
   ```
