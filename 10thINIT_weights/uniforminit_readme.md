# README for PyTorch Linear Layer and Uniform Initialization

## Introduction
This script demonstrates the use of linear layers and uniform initialization in PyTorch, a popular machine learning library.

## Code Overview
The script consists of the following key components:

1. **Import Statements**: The script imports necessary modules from PyTorch.
    ```python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    ```

2. **Linear Layer Creation**: Two linear layers (`layer0` and `layer1`) are created using `nn.Linear`. The first layer transforms input from 16 to 32 features, and the second layer from 32 to 64 features.
    ```python
    layer0 = nn.Linear(16,32)
    layer1 = nn.Linear(32,64)
    ```

3. **Initial Weights Display**: The script initially displays the minimum and maximum values of the weights of both layers, to show the range of values before any explicit initialization.
    ```python
    print("Before uniform init")
    print(layer0.weight.min(), layer0.weight.max())
    print(layer1.weight.min(), layer1.weight.max())
    ```

4. **Uniform Initialization**: The weights of both layers are initialized uniformly using `nn.init.uniform_`. This method modifies the weights in place, assigning values drawn from a uniform distribution.
    ```python
    nn.init.uniform_(layer0.weight)
    nn.init.uniform_(layer1.weight)
    ```

5. **Weights Display After Initialization**: After initialization, the script again prints the minimum and maximum values of the weights of both layers to show the effect of the uniform initialization.
    ```python
    print("After Uniform init")
    print(layer0.weight.min(), layer0.weight.max())
    print(layer1.weight.min(), layer1.weight.max())
    ```

## Purpose
The purpose of this script is to illustrate how linear layers can be defined in PyTorch and how their weights can be initialized using a uniform distribution. This is a common practice in neural network initialization, ensuring that the weights have small values before starting the training process.

## How to Run
- Ensure you have PyTorch installed in your environment.
- Run the script using a Python interpreter.
- Observe the change in weight values before and after the uniform initialization.

## Conclusion
This script provides a basic example of defining linear layers in PyTorch and initializing their weights. Such initialization techniques are crucial for the successful training of neural networks.
